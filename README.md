# Weather-Forecast
Developed a Python-based Weather Forecast application that retrieves and displays real-time weather data by automatically detecting the user's location using the IPInfo API and converting coordinates into city names via Geopy's Nominatim API.

Integrated WeatherAPI to fetch current weather conditions such as temperature, feels-like temperature, and weather status, ensuring accurate and reliable real-time weather updates.

Designed and implemented an interactive GUI using Tkinter, allowing users to fetch and view weather information with a single click, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.
